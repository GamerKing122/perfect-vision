# Perfect Vision (Foundry VTT Module)

Perfect Vision offers additional lighting and vision settings and allows you to control lighting and vision locally within the shape of a drawing.
It gives you the ability control the maximum vision and detection ranges within the area of drawings, lights, templates, or scenes.

Perfect Vision adds/exposes the following lighting and vision settings.
- **Global Illumination**: The global light source is completely configurable with all the usual light options.
- **Animation Resolution**: Control the scale of the animation of a light source.
- **Daylight/Darkness Color**: The colors of illumination at Darkness Level 0 and 1 respectively.
- **Reveal Fog of War**: Reveal the fog of war for all users. This does not override the saved fog exploration progress.
- **Vision Limitation**: Configure the maximum range that tokens can see.

A drawing, if enabled, allows you to control lighting and vision within the shape of the drawing. The drawings have a similar behavior as roof tiles: they block lighting below the drawings elevation. With the *Fit To Walls* option you can constrain the area of effect of the drawing to the underlying wall structure, which is a lot faster then using the polygon tool. For polygon drawings I recommend the [Advanced Drawing Tools](https://github.com/dev7355608/advanced-drawing-tools) module, which makes it possible to edit polygons in case you make a mistake or need to change the shape.

Perfect Vision adds the *Lighting* setting in the *Overhead* tab of the tile configuration, which allows you to choose the lighting and vision settings of the area on and above a roof/level tile. By default roofs/levels use the lighting settings of the scene. This setting as no effect if the tile isn't an overhead roof/level tile.

Perfect Vision adds the option to restrict the vision range of tokens in illuminated areas.

Perfect Vision improves the token visibility test such that tokens close a wall won't be visible through the wall on the other side it.

Perfect Vision includes multiple performance improvements; most notably fog exploration optimizations, which eliminate lags/freezes almost entirely that occur when the fog exploration is saved.
